# ![DataLynX Logo](../assets/datalynx_logo.svg){ width="50" } eXplorer Structure & Navigation

The **eXplorer** is the primary navigation tree in DataLynX, located on the left side of the UI. It provides hierarchical access to all configuration, devices, logic blocks, and system tools.

Understanding the eXplorer structure is essential for efficient navigation and workflow management in DataLynX.

---

## eXplorer Tree Overview

When you log into DataLynX with the agent running, you'll see the following top-level structure:

```
DataLynX (root)
├── System
├── Connections
├── Hierarchy
├── Supervisor
├── Manage Users
└── Manage Licenses
```

![eXplorer Top Node](../img/DataLynX - eXplorer Top Node.PNG)

Each of these nodes serves a specific purpose in the DataLynX ecosystem.

### **Hierarchy**

The **Hierarchy** node is your digital twin workspace—a flexible area where you can mirror physical building infrastructure, organize custom logic and calculations, and build BasiX profiles for BDX.

**Purpose:**

- Build BasiX device profiles that get sent to the BDX agent
- Create custom calculations and logic (efficiency metrics, aggregations, fault detection)
- Organize blocks by physical layout (campuses, buildings, zones) OR by function (calculations, profiles, virtual meters)
- Build data transformation flows in whatever structure makes sense for your site
- Maintain separation between physical BACnet devices (under Connections) and logical processing (under Hierarchy)

**Example Structure:**
```
Hierarchy
├── Campus_Main
│   ├── Building_A
│   │   ├── AHUs
│   │   │   ├── AHU-1 [logic blocks]
│   │   │   └── AHU-2 [logic blocks]
│   │   ├── VAVs
│   │   └── Lighting
│   └── Building_B
│       ├── Chiller_Plant
│       └── Boiler_Plant
├── Water_System_Devices
│   ├── Pumps
│   └── Cooling_Towers
└── Central_Plant
    ├── Chillers
    └── Boilers
```

**When to use:**

- Creating BasiX device profiles to send to BDX
- Building custom calculations (efficiency, aggregations, virtual meters)
- Organizing logic by physical layout, equipment type, or analytical function
- Developing virtual points that combine multiple physical points
- Creating fault detection and monitoring logic
- Preparing all data processing that feeds the BDX agent

**Key Concept:**
The Hierarchy is where **all your custom work lives**:

- BasiX profiles for BDX are built here
- Custom calculations and logic are organized here
- Flow View workspace operates within Hierarchy folders
- This is your canvas—structure it however makes sense for your needs

---

## Navigation Patterns

### **Breadcrumb Navigation**

When you click on an eXplorer node, the top of the screen shows a breadcrumb path:

```
/Hierarchy/Campus_Main/Building_A/AHUs
```

or

```
/Connections/BACnet/devices/Honeywell_Controller
```

This shows your current location in the tree and helps you understand context when working in Flow View or configuration pages.

---

### **Flow View Context**

When you select a node in the eXplorer:

- The **center workspace** shows the Flow View for that node (if it contains blocks)
- The **right panel** shows the Toolbox (with block categories)
- The **Edit Block** panel appears when you select a block

**Example:**

- Click on `Hierarchy → AHUs → AHU-1`
- Flow View opens showing all logic blocks for AHU-1
- Toolbox appears on the right with available block types
- You can drag blocks, create links, and build logic flows

---

### **Switching Between Views**

The top-right corner shows the **Active View** toggle:

- **Flow View** - Visual block-based logic workspace (most common)
- **Mapping Editor** - Used when working with BasiX mapping schemes
- **Other views** - Context-dependent based on the selected node

---

## Organizing Your Workspace

### **Best Practices for Hierarchy Organization**

1. **Mirror Physical Layout:**
   ```
   Hierarchy
   ├── Campus_North
   ├── Campus_South
   └── Remote_Sites
   ```

2. **Or Organize by System Type:**
   ```
   Hierarchy
   ├── HVAC_Equipment
   ├── Lighting_Systems
   ├── Electrical_Monitoring
   └── Water_Systems
   ```

3. **Or Combine Both:**
   ```
   Hierarchy
   ├── Building_1
   │   ├── HVAC
   │   └── Lighting
   └── Building_2
       ├── HVAC
       └── Lighting
   ```

### **Creating Folders**

To create a new folder in Hierarchy:
1. Right-click on Hierarchy (or a subfolder)
2. Select **New Folder** (or use Toolbox → Folder)
3. Name the folder
4. Drag blocks into the folder or create new logic inside it

## Key Concepts Summary

1. **Physical vs Logical Separation:**
   - **Connections/BACnet/devices** = Physical BACnet devices from the network
   - **Hierarchy** = Logical organization and custom data processing

2. **Flow View is Everywhere:**
   - Most eXplorer nodes can be opened in Flow View
   - This is where you visualize and edit logic blocks

3. **Breadcrumbs Show Context:**
   - Always check the breadcrumb path to know where you are
   - Helps when navigating complex nested structures

4. **Hierarchy is Your Canvas:**
   - This is where you build the digital twin
   - Organize it to match how you think about your building systems
