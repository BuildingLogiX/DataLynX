# ![DataLynX Logo](assets/datalynx_logo.svg){ width="50" } **DataLynX Documentation**

**DataLynX** is a modern, high-performance BACnet agent and integration framework designed for the BuildingLogiX ecosystem.
Built on Python, it provides fast, reliable BACnet/IP communication, powerful data transformation and logic capabilities, and seamless integration with the BuildingLogiX Data eXchange (BDX).

---

## 🚀 What is DataLynX?

DataLynX acts as the **bridge between on-premises building automation systems (BAS)** and the **BDX (BuildingLogiX Data eXchange)** analytics platform.

Built entirely in **Python**, DataLynX leverages modern libraries and frameworks to deliver enterprise-grade performance, extensibility, and reliability.

It provides:

- **BACnet/IP communication**
  Full client support, router/FDT handling, polling, discovery, and device health monitoring.

- **Data Transformation & Logic Flow**
  Visual wiresheet interface (Flow View) for transforming BAS values, scaling units, creating virtual points, and performing custom logic.

- **BasiX Ontology & Profiles**
  Standardized device and point modeling to normalize diverse BAS data into a common structure.

- **User Interface**  
  A clean web UI for configuring networks, discovering devices, managing BasiX mappings, monitoring live values, and navigating logic flows.

- **Secure communication to BDX**
  Agent registration, data pumping, and remote commands/status handling.

- **Windows Services**  
  The DataLynX installation includes system services for Agent execution, background operations, and UI hosting.

## 🌐 How DataLynX Fits into the BDX Ecosystem

DataLynX is designed to work seamlessly with:

- **[BDX (BuildingLogiX Data eXchange)](https://buildinglogix.github.io/BDX/)**
  Analytics platform that receives normalized data from Agents.

- **Supervisor UI**
  Remote visibility into Agents, status, and device mappings.

- **BDXpy**
  Python SDK for interacting programmatically with BDX data.

DataLynX handles on-prem BAS communication, computation, and normalization so BDX can focus on long-term storage, analytics, and visualization.
